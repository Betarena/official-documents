Risk Factors

You should carefully consider and evaluate each of the following risk factors and all other information contained in these Terms before deciding to participate in the Token Sale. To the best of the Company’s knowledge and belief, all risk factors which are material to you in making an informed judgment to participate in the Token Sale have been set out below. If any of the following considerations, uncertainties or material risks develops into actual events, the business, financial position and/or results of operations of the Company and the maintenance and level of usage of the Tokens could be materially and adversely affected. In such cases, the trading price of Tokens could decline due to any of these considerations, uncertainties or material risks, and you may lose all or part of your Tokens or the economic value thereof.
Risks Relating to Participation in the Token Sale

The Token Sale may not result in an active or liquid market for the Tokens.

In the event that the Company ever decides to seek the approval for availability of the Tokens for trading on any cryptocurrency exchange, there is no assurance that such approval will be obtained. Furthermore, even if such approval is granted by a cryptocurrency exchange, there is no assurance that an active or liquid trading market for the Tokens will develop, or if developed, will be sustained after the Tokens have been made available for trading on such market. There is also no assurance that the market price of the Tokens will not decline below the original or issue purchase price/Token Private Sale Price (the “Purchase Price”). The Purchase Price may not be indicative of the market price of the Tokens after they have been made available for trading on a market.A Token is not a currency issued by any central bank or national, supra-national or quasi-national organisation, nor is it backed by any hard assets or other credit nor is it a commodity in the traditional sense of that word. The Company is not responsible for, nor does it pursue, the circulation and trading of Tokens on any market. Trading of Tokens will merely depend on the consensus on its value between the relevant market participants. No one is obliged to purchase any Token from any holder of the Token, including the purchasers, nor does anyone guarantee the liquidity or market price of Tokens to any extent at any time. Furthermore, Tokens may not be resold to purchasers who are citizens, nationals, residents (tax or otherwise) and/or green card holders of Restricted Jurisdictions or to Restricted Persons or to purchasers in any other jurisdiction where the purchase of Tokens may be in violation of applicable laws. Accordingly, the Company cannot ensure that there will be any demand or market for Tokens, or that the Purchase Price is indicative of the market price of Tokens after they have been made available for trading on any cryptocurrency exchange or market.

Future sales or issuance of the Tokens could materially and adversely affect the market price of Tokens.

Any future sale of the Tokens would increase the supply of Tokens in the market and this may result in a downward price pressure on the Token. The sale or distribution of a significant number of Tokens outside of the Token Sale (including but not limited to transfer of Tokens to persons other than purchasers for purposes of community initiatives, business development, academic research, education and market expansion and issuance of Tokens as a reward to users of the Betarena that is being further developed or otherwise), or the perception that such further sales may occur, could adversely affect the trading price of the Tokens.

Negative publicity may materially and adversely affect the price of the Tokens.

Negative publicity involving the Company, the Company’s that is being further developed, the Tokens or any of the key personnel of the Company and/or regulation of distributed ledger technologies, cryptocurrencies and/or crowdsales of tokens in any jurisdiction, may materially and adversely affect the market perception or market price of the Tokens, whether or not it is justified.

There is no assurance of any success of the Company’s Token Sale or business platform that is being further developed as envisaged by the Available Information.

The value of, and demand for, the Tokens hinges heavily on the performance of the Company’s Token Sale and Betarena that is being further developed and the continuous active engagement of its users and success of its contemplated business lines. There is no assurance that the Company’s Token Sale will be successful or that the Betarena that is being further developed will gain or continue to gain traction. While the Company has made every effort to provide a realistic estimate, there is also no assurance that the cryptocurrencies raised in the Token Sale will be sufficient for the development of Betarena. For the foregoing or any other reason, the development of Betarena and launch of the anticipated Token functionality may not be completed and there is no assurance that it will be launched at all. As such, distributed Tokens may hold little or no worth or value and this would impact any trading price and/or use of the Tokens.

The trading price of the Tokens may fluctuate following the Token Sale.

The prices of cryptographic tokens in general tend to be relatively volatile, and can fluctuate significantly over short periods of time. The demand for, and the corresponding market price of, the Tokens may fluctuate significantly and rapidly in response to, among others, the following factors, some of which are beyond the control of the Company:· new technical innovations;· analysts’ speculations, recommendations, perceptions or estimates of the Token’s market price or the Company’s financial and business performance;· changes in market valuations and token prices of entities with businesses similar to that of the Company that may be listed on the same cryptocurrency exchanges or markets as the Tokens;· announcements by the Company of significant events, for example partnerships, sponsorships or new product developments;· fluctuations in market prices and trading volume of cryptocurrencies on cryptocurrency exchanges or markets;· additions or departures of key personnel of the Company;· success or failure of the Company’s management in implementing business and growth strategies; and/or· changes in conditions affecting the blockchain or financial technology industry, the general economic conditions or market sentiments, or other events or factors.
Risks Relating to the Company

Betarena continues to be developed.

Any events or circumstances which adversely affect the Company or any of its Affiliates may have a corresponding adverse effect on Betarena that is being further developed, including but not limited to the development, structuring Betarena. Such adverse effects would correspondingly have an impact on the utility, liquidity, and the trading price of the Tokens.

The Company or its Affiliates may be materially and adversely affected if it fails to effectively manage its operations as its business develops and evolves, which would have a direct impact on its ability to develop, maintain or operate Betarena and/or develop, structure and/or license any Token functionality.

The financial technology and cryptocurrency industries in which the Company competes have grown rapidly over the past few years and continue to evolve in response to new technological advances, changing business models, shifting regulations and other factors. As a result of this constantly changing environment, the Company may face operational difficulties in adjusting to the changes, and the sustainability of Betarena will depend on the ability of the Company or its Affiliates to manage its operations, ensure that it hires qualified and competent employees, and provides proper training for its personnel. As Betarena develops, the Company and/or its Affiliates must also expand and adapt its operational infrastructure. Betarena will in part rely on its blockchain-based software systems, cryptocurrency wallets or other related token storage mechanisms, blockchain technology and smart contract technology. All of these systems, tools, and skill sets represent complex, costly, and rapidly changing technical infrastructure. In order to demonstrate continued ability to effectively manage technical support infrastructure for Betarena that is being further developed and the future functionality of the Tokens, the Company and/or its Affiliates will need to continue to upgrade and improve its data systems and other operational systems, procedures, and controls. These upgrades and improvements will require a dedication of resources and are likely to be complex and increasingly rely on hosted computer services from third parties that the Company and/or its Affiliates do not or will not control. If the Company and/or its Affiliates are unable to adapt their systems and organisation in a timely, efficient, and cost-effective manner to accommodate changing circumstances, its business, financial condition and/or results of operations may be adversely affected. If the third parties whom the Company and/or its Affiliates rely on are subject to a security breach or otherwise suffer disruptions that impact the services the Company and/or its Affiliates use, the integrity and availability of its internal information could be compromised, which may consequently cause the loss of confidential or proprietary information and/or economic loss. The loss of financial, labour or other resources, and any other adverse effect on the Company and/or its Affiliates, financial condition and/or operations, would have a direct adverse effect on the ability of the Company and/or its Affiliates to develop maintain or operate Betarena and/or to develop, structure and/or license the anticipated Token functionality. Any adverse effects affecting the Betarena or technology are likely to also adversely impact the utility, liquidity, and trading price of the Tokens.

The Company may experience system failures, unplanned interruptions in its network or services, hardware or software defects, security breaches or other causes that could adversely affect the Company’s infrastructure network, and/or Betarena that is being further developed.

The Company and/or its Affiliates are not able to anticipate when there would be occurrences of hacks, cyber-attacks, distributed denials of service or errors, vulnerabilities or defects in: Betarena that is being further developed, in the smart contracts on which the Company and/or its Affiliates or Betarena relies, or on the Ethereum or any other blockchain. Such events may include, for example, flaws in programming or source code leading to exploitation or abuse thereof. The Company and/or its Affiliates may not be able to detect such hacks, cyber-attacks, distributed denials of service errors vulnerabilities or defects in a timely manner, and may not have sufficient resources to efficiently cope with multiple service incidents happening simultaneously or in rapid succession.The network or services of the Company and/or its Affiliates, which would include Betarena that is being further developed and, if successfully structured, developed, licensed and launched, the Token functionality, could be disrupted by numerous events, including natural disasters, equipment breakdown, network connectivity downtime, power losses, or even intentional disruptions of its services, such as disruptions caused by software viruses or attacks by unauthorised users, some of which are beyond the control of the Company and/or its Affiliates. There can be no assurance that cyber-attacks, such as distributed denials of service, will not be attempted in the future or that the security measures of the Company and/or its Affiliates will be effective. The Company and/or its Affiliates may be prone to attacks on its infrastructure intended to steal information about its technology, financial data or user information or take other actions that would be damaging to the Company and/or holders of the Tokens. Any significant breach of the security measures of the Company and/or its Affiliates or other disruptions resulting in a compromise of the usability, stability, and security of Betarena that is being further developed may adversely affect the utility, liquidity and/or trading price of the Tokens.

The Company and/or its Affiliates may in the future be dependent in part on the location and data centre facilities of third parties.

The future infrastructure network of the Company and/or its Affiliates may be established in whole or in part through servers which they own and/or houses at the location facilities of third parties, and/or servers that it rents at data centre facilities of third parties. If the Company and/or its Affiliates are unable to renew their data facility leases on commercially reasonable terms or at all, the Company and/or its Affiliates may be required to transfer its servers to a new data centre facility, and may incur significant costs and possible service interruption in connection with the relocation. These facilities are also vulnerable to damage or interruption from, among others, natural disasters, arson, terrorist attacks, power losses, and telecommunication failures.Additionally, the third-party providers of such facilities may suffer a breach of security as a result of third-party action, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise, and a third party may obtain unauthorised access to the data in such servers. The Company and/or its Affiliates and the providers of such facilities may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures.

General global market and economic conditions may have an adverse impact on the operating performance, results of operations and/or cash flows of the Company and/or its Affiliates.

The Company and/or its Affiliates could continue to be affected by general global economic and market conditions. Challenging economic conditions worldwide have from time to time, contributed, and may continue to contribute, to slowdowns in the information technology industry at large. Weakness in the economy could have a negative effect on the Company and/or its Affiliates’ business, operations and financial condition, including decreases in revenue and operating cash flows, and inability to attract future equity and/or debt financing on commercially reasonable terms. Additionally, in a down-cycle economic environment, the Company and/or its Affiliates may experience the negative effects of a slowdown in trading and usage of Betarena that is being further developed and may delay or cancel the development, structuring, licensing and/or launch of the anticipated Token functionality.Suppliers on which the Company and/or its Affiliates rely for servers, bandwidth, location and other services could also be negatively impacted by economic conditions that, in turn, could have a negative impact on the operations or expenses of the Company and/or its Affiliates. There can be no assurance, therefore, that current economic conditions or worsening economic conditions or a prolonged or recurring recession will not have a significant, adverse impact on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations, and hence, Betarena that is being further developed and/or the ability to develop, structure, license and/or launch any Token functionality. Any such circumstances would then correspondingly negatively impact the utility, liquidity, and/or trading price of the Tokens.

The Company and/or its Affiliates or the Tokens may be affected by newly implemented regulations.

Distributed ledger technologies, businesses and activities as well as cryptocurrencies and cryptocurrency-related businesses and activities are generally unregulated worldwide, but numerous regulatory authorities across jurisdictions have been outspoken about considering the implementation of regulatory regimes which govern distributed ledger technologies, businesses and activities as well as cryptocurrencies and cryptocurrency-related businesses and activities. The Company and/or its Affiliates or the Tokens may be affected by newly implemented regulations relating to distributed ledger technologies, businesses and activities as well as cryptocurrencies and cryptocurrency-related businesses and activities, including having to take measures to comply with such regulations, or having to deal with queries, notices, requests or enforcement actions by regulatory authorities, which may come at a substantial cost and may also require substantial modifications to Betarena that is being further developed and/or the anticipated Token functionality. This may impact the appeal or practicality or functionality of the Betarena that is being further developed and/or the anticipated Token functionality for users and result in decreased usage of and demand for Betarena and the Tokens. Further, should the costs (financial or otherwise) of complying with such newly implemented regulations exceed a certain threshold, maintaining Betarena that is being further developed and/or developing, structuring, licensing and/or launching the Token functionality may no longer be commercially viable, and the Company and/or its Affiliates may opt to discontinue Betarena that is being further developed and/or the anticipated Token functionality, and/or the Tokens. Further, it is difficult to predict how or whether governments or regulatory authorities may implement any changes to laws and regulations affecting distributed ledger technology and its applications, including Betarena that is being further developed and/or the anticipated Token functionality, and/or the Tokens.The Company and/or its Affiliates may also have to cease operations in a jurisdiction that makes it illegal to operate in such jurisdiction, or make it commercially unviable or undesirable to obtain the necessary regulatory approval(s) to operate in such jurisdiction. In scenarios such as the foregoing, the utility, liquidity, and/or trading price of Tokens will be adversely affected and/or Tokens may cease to be traded.

There may be unanticipated risks arising from the Tokens.

Cryptographic tokens such as the Tokens are a relatively new and dynamic technology. In addition to the risks included in the above discussion of risk factors, there are other risks associated with your purchase, holding, and use of the Tokens, including those that the Company and/or its Affiliates cannot anticipate. Such risks may further appear as unanticipated variations or combinations of the risks discussed above.
